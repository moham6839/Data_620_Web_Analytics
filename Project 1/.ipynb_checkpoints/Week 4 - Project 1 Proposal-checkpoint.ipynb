    "Your task in this week’s assignment is to identify an interesting set of network data that is available on the web (either through web scraping or web APIs) that could be used for analyzing and comparing centrality measures across nodes.  As an additional constraint, there should be at least one categorical variable available for each node (such as “Male” or “Female”; “Republican”, “Democrat,” or “Undecided”, etc.)\n",

    "A theoretical dataset that can be used involves assessing the risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Using variables such as age, weight, height, smoking status, cholesterol, alcohol consumption, and physical activity status can help form a baseline structure of the potential risk factors developing heart disease. Identifying patterns among the risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease can help us understand which variables have the most connections to other nodes (factors), the most influential factor between other nodes, the shortest path to other nodes, and how influential a node is to others based on how connected the other nodes are. For reference, here is a link to a network analysis exploring how adverse childhood experiences are associated with cardiovascular disease: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235282732300023X#fig2"

Variables include age, gender, height, weight, blood pressure values, cholesterol levels, glucose levels, smoking habits and alcohol consumption of over 70,000 individuals. Here are what the following centrality measures can help us understand when assessing how integral each of the risk factors are to CVD:"
